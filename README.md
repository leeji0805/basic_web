Write a paragraph describing these activities, using time-order words like “First,” “Then,” “Next,” “After that,” and “Finally.” First, I wake up and eat breakfast to start my day. Then, I attend my classes and focus on learning new programming concepts. After that, I have lunch before continuing my studies by working on assignments and projects. Next, I take a short break to relax. In the evening, I review my lessons to make sure I understand everything. Finally, I have dinner and unwind before going to bed.
